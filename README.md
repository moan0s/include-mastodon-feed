## FAQ

### How do I find my account ID?
As an instance admin you can easily read your user ID in the admin backend. As regular user you can try an API v2 search to find your ID

Use the following URL to get your ID:

```https://example.org/api/v2/search?q=username@example.org&resolve=true&limit=5```

* Change `example.org` to your instance
* Replace `username` with your handle.
* Open the URL in your webbrowser

**Note:** You must be logged in to do that

### Can I modify the plugin?
The plugin is released unter the [Expat License](LICENSE) which is very permissive. Knock youself out!
